    "Parallel communication takes place via logical events in network connection objects known as [NetCon](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/modelspec/programmatic/network/netcon.html).\n",
    "NetCon sources are threshold detectors. They monitor some variable, say the membrane potential of a cell, and when the variable reaches some threshold, it triggers an event sent to the targets. Targets are frequently synapses on other cells. When they receive the event, they activate.\n",

    "In a parallel context across several machines, communication between hosts can be computationally inefficient when the frequency of events is high and when the message being sent is large. NEURON uses an efficient priority queueing mechanism to deliver events to targets after the delay specified by the NetCon. The message passed is succinct. It is an integer, the unique global identifier (gid) of the source.\n",
